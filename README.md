# Etch-a-Sketch

# Description: 

    This is a simple project that lies in between sketchpad and etch-a-sketch but only titled it as "Etch-a-Sketch" in the repository to associate it with the odin project exercise. The project offers a default 16x16 grid pad where you can sketch all you want with your mouse as a pen tool and leave a mark of completely random color along each grid boxes. There are two buttons that offers simple functionality such as the "CREATE GRID" where you can customize the grid to have a number of boxes per side and the "CLEAR GRID" which simply clears out the non-white colors on your grid and reset it to all white.


# Challenges creating the project:

    1. Choosing in between grid and flex for display type in container was challenging. It took me couple of experimenting until I decided to choose flex for its alignment compatibility.

    2. As I was completely new to event listeners, it took me a lot of time to find the right event and terms associated with click and hover to activate the desired output for sketching the grid.

# Things I have learned:

    1. Learned new javascript methods unfamiliar to me.
    2. assigning multiple event listeners to an element and make them behave with the use of condition that depends on the state of a relevant event.
    3. Broader knowledge in optimizing nested containers
    4. Improved familiarity to flexbox and transform property in css
